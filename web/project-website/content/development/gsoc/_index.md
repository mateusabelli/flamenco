Flamenco is a Blender Foundation project, and is also part of Blender's GSoC
programme.

## Hints & Tips

The most important tip: **use your own brain. Show that you can think and find
information yourself. This will greatly increase your chance of acceptance.** So
congratulations, you found this page! That's a good start.

Another way to increase your chances: **don't over-sell your skills**. Using
Flamenco once or twice is not enough to say you "*know Flamenco*". If you don't
know all of the programming languages and techniques used in the project, that
doesn't have to be any problem. But discuss it. For example, saying "*I've never
used Go*" is fine, but do make it explicit that this is the case, and also
explain why you think it's fine to still apply for joining this Go-based
project.

When you link to your work to show off your skills, that's great! But make sure
that it is clear **what was written by you, and what was written by somebody else**.
If the Git history only has commits in your name, and there is no description
like "copied code from ${LOCATION} as a starting point", then realise that the
rest of the world will think this is your code. Be careful, this could be seen
as plagiarism. Many Open Source licenses require you to credit the original
authors.

And finally: **be part of the community**. Join the chat, use Flamenco, get
involved. Communicate with your mentor. If you have questions, pop in the
Flamenco chat channel and ask them (but please also scroll back a little to see
if someone else already asked the same thing). Flamenco is an open project, and
that also means discussing things openly. That way everybody can help you answer
questions, and everybody can benefit from the answers you get.

## Getting Started

There is a lot of documentation already on how to get started with GSoC:

- [Flamenco's Getting Started][flamenco-start] page.
- [Blender's GSoC: Getting Started][blender-gsoc] page.
- [Blender's guidelines on contributing code][contributing] also applies to
  Flamenco. Be sure to give it a read-through, as it has useful information and
  will make the whole process of getting your changes into Flamenco a more
  pleasant one.
- The [Go documentation][go-doc] is pretty good. If you're not familiar with the
  language, this is a great place to start learning about it.
- And finally, there's a list of [good first issues][first-issues] that should
  be relatively simple to resolve, and thus may be a nice way into the project.

Make sure you [join the chat room][chat] to discuss your ideas, ask questions,
or just to introduce yourself.
